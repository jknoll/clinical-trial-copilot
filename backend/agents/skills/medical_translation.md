# Medical Translation Skill

This skill translates clinical and medical language into plain language at an 8th grade reading level. Apply these rules whenever generating patient-facing content.

## Translation Rules

1. **Replace jargon immediately.** Do not use a medical term without a plain language equivalent. On first use, provide the plain term followed by the medical term in parentheses: "a treatment that uses your body's own defenses to fight disease (immunotherapy)."

2. **Use concrete numbers instead of vague quantifiers.** Replace "some patients" with "about 3 in 10 people." Replace "rarely" with "fewer than 1 in 100 people." Replace "commonly" with "about 5 in 10 people."

3. **Use analogies for abstract concepts.** Randomization: "like flipping a coin to decide which group you join." Double-blind: "neither you nor your doctor will know which treatment you are getting, so the results are not influenced by expectations." Biomarker: "a specific feature of your disease that doctors can test for, like a fingerprint that helps identify which treatments might work."

4. **Keep sentences short.** Aim for 15-20 words per sentence. Break complex ideas into multiple sentences.

5. **Use active voice.** "The doctor will take a blood sample" not "A blood sample will be obtained."

6. **Avoid abbreviations on first use.** Write the full term first, then introduce the abbreviation: "complete blood count (CBC)."

## Common Translations Table

| Medical Term | Plain Language |
|---|---|
| Randomized | Assigned to a treatment group by chance, like flipping a coin |
| Double-blind | Neither you nor your doctor knows which treatment you are receiving |
| Placebo-controlled | One group gets the real treatment, another gets an inactive version for comparison |
| ECOG Performance Status | A measure of how well you can carry out daily activities |
| Progression-free survival (PFS) | How long the treatment keeps the disease from getting worse |
| Overall survival (OS) | How long people live after starting treatment |
| Adverse events | Side effects or health problems that happen during the study |
| Efficacy | How well a treatment works |
| Contraindicated | Not recommended because it could be harmful in your situation |
| Refractory | The disease did not respond to a previous treatment |
| Line of therapy | Each new treatment approach tried, counted in order (first-line, second-line) |
| Washout period | A waiting time between stopping one treatment and starting another |
| Informed consent | A process where the study team explains everything about the trial and you decide whether to join |
| Stratified | Patients are divided into smaller groups based on characteristics before being assigned to treatment |
| Crossover | At some point in the study, patients switch from one treatment group to another |
| Maintenance therapy | Ongoing treatment given after the main treatment to help keep the disease under control |
| Dose escalation | The treatment dose is gradually increased to find the right amount |
| Objective response rate (ORR) | The percentage of people whose tumors shrank or disappeared during treatment |
| Monotherapy | Treatment with a single drug, rather than a combination |
| Combination therapy | Treatment with two or more drugs given together |

## Quality Check

Before finalizing any patient-facing text, verify:
- No unexplained medical terms remain.
- All numbers use concrete, understandable formats.
- Sentences average under 20 words.
- A motivated 8th grader could understand every sentence.
