# Why Clinical Trial Navigator — 30s Video Script

Over half a million clinical trials are registered today — yet 80% fail to recruit on time, and one in five never enrolls a single patient.

It's not that patients don't want to participate. When offered a trial, 55% say yes. The problem is they never hear about it. 85% of cancer patients didn't even know trials were an option at diagnosis.

Meanwhile, every day of delay costs sponsors up to $8 million. And for patients with rare or treatment-resistant diseases — over 7,000 conditions affecting 400 million people worldwide — a clinical trial may be their only hope.

The system is also deeply inequitable. Black and Latinx patients are enrolled at a fraction of expected rates, undermining both the science and the people it's supposed to serve.

AI can fix this — matching patients to trials automatically, closing the awareness gap, and making cutting-edge care accessible to everyone.

**The bridge between patients and clinical trials is broken. We're rebuilding it.**
