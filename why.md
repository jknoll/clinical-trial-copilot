# The Clinical Trial Matching Crisis: A Broken Bridge Between Patients and Progress

Clinical trials are the backbone of medical innovation — every drug, device, and therapy must pass through them before reaching patients. Yet the system for connecting trials with participants is staggeringly inefficient, creating bottlenecks that delay treatments, inflate costs, and cost lives.

## The Scale of the Problem

There are more than 500,000 clinical trials registered on [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov), spanning nearly every disease and condition.[^1] Yet the vast majority struggle to find enough participants. Nearly 80% of clinical trials fail to meet their original enrollment deadline, and up to 20% of trials fail to enroll any participants at all.[^2][^3] Nearly one in five registered clinical trials is terminated early, often due to insufficient recruitment.[^4] Global data analysis of terminated trials within the ClinicalTrials.gov database found that 55% were terminated due to low accrual rate — the single highest reason for termination.[^5]

The numbers on the patient side are equally stark. The overall participation rate in cancer treatment trials is approximately 7.1%, with rates as low as 2–4% at community sites.[^6] According to a 2001 Harris Interactive Survey, 85% of cancer patients were either unaware or unsure that clinical trial participation was an option at the time of diagnosis, but 75% said they would have been willing to enroll had they known it was possible.[^7] A meta-analysis found that when patients are actually offered a clinical trial, 55% agree to participate — demonstrating that the gap is driven by awareness and access, not reluctance.[^8] Only 9% of Americans report ever having been invited to participate in a clinical trial.[^9]

## Why Recruitment Is So Hard

The difficulty is multifaceted. Trial eligibility criteria can be extraordinarily complex — a single oncology trial may have 30–50 inclusion/exclusion criteria spanning biomarkers, prior treatments, organ function thresholds, and comorbidities. As trial designs have become more sophisticated, inclusion criteria have become more specific and stringent, requiring intensive trial-related testing and restricting the pool of eligible participants.[^5] A Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development report found that the total number of endpoints in a protocol increased 86% between 2001–2005 and 2011–2015.[^10]

Geography compounds the problem. An estimated 70% of potential clinical trial participants live more than two hours away from the nearest study site, creating a systemic bias toward patients in urban academic medical centers and away from rural, minority, and underserved populations.[^11][^12] This directly undermines the diversity and generalizability of trial results — a growing concern for regulators and the research community alike.

## The Cost of Delay

Recruitment delays are the single largest driver of clinical trial cost overruns. Each day a trial runs behind schedule costs sponsors an estimated $600,000 to $8 million in lost revenue for late-to-market drugs.[^13][^14] The full drug development cycle averages 10–15 years, and the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development estimates the average cost of developing a new drug at $2.6 billion, including the cost of failures.[^15][^16] A 2020 study in *JAMA* estimated median R&D costs at $985 million and mean costs at $1.3 billion per approved drug, depending on methodology.[^17] Recruitment inefficiency accounts for a meaningful share of both the time and money.

## Why It Matters for Patients

For patients — especially those with serious, rare, or treatment-resistant conditions — a clinical trial may represent the only path to a potentially life-saving therapy. There are more than 7,000 identified rare diseases, collectively affecting approximately 300–400 million people worldwide, and roughly 95% lack approved treatments.[^18][^19][^20] Late-stage cancer patients and those who have exhausted standard-of-care options depend on access to experimental treatments. Every month a trial is delayed in recruiting is a month those patients go without access.

Moreover, clinical trial participation is itself associated with better outcomes. As noted by experts at the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation, enrolling in a clinical trial can offer patients options otherwise unavailable and access to top-quality medical care, while also contributing to the advancement of medical knowledge.[^7]

## The Diversity Imperative

Historically, clinical trials have enrolled disproportionately white, male, and affluent participants. Black Americans make up about 14% of the U.S. population but only 5–7% of clinical trial participants broadly, and representation is even lower in oncology — approximately 8.5% of participants in interventional oncology trials from 2010–2021, despite bearing a disproportionate cancer burden.[^21][^22] A JAMA Network Open study found that oncology trial participation was lower among Black patients (4.4%) and Latinx patients (4.2%) compared with White patients (7.2%) across five major cancer types from 2017–2022.[^23] A study of landmark trials leading to FDA oncology drug approvals found Black and Latinx patients were enrolled at only 22% and 44% of expected rates based on cancer incidence, respectively.[^24]

This undermines the science — drugs may behave differently across genetic backgrounds, metabolic profiles, and social determinants of health — and it perpetuates health inequities. The FDA has increasingly pushed for diversity action plans, but the matching infrastructure to reach underserved populations remains inadequate.[^23]

## The Opportunity

The convergence of electronic health records, natural language processing, and AI-driven matching creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity to close this gap — automatically screening patients against trial criteria, surfacing relevant opportunities to both patients and physicians, and dramatically compressing the recruitment timeline. Getting this right doesn't just accelerate drug development. It democratizes access to cutting-edge care and ensures that the therapies we develop actually work for the full diversity of people who will use them.

**The bridge between clinical trials and the patients who need them is broken. Rebuilding it is one of the highest-impact problems in healthcare today.**
