# The Clinical Trial Matching Crisis: A Broken Bridge Between Patients and Progress

Clinical trials are the backbone of medical innovation — every drug, device, and therapy must pass through them before reaching patients. Yet the system for connecting trials with participants is staggeringly inefficient, creating bottlenecks that delay treatments, inflate costs, and cost lives.

## The Scale of the Problem

There are roughly 450,000+ clinical trials registered on [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) at any given time, spanning nearly every disease and condition. Yet the vast majority struggle to find enough participants. Around 80% of clinical trials fail to meet their enrollment timelines, and up to 30% of trials never enroll a single participant. Nearly 20% of registered trials are terminated early, often due to insufficient recruitment.

The numbers on the patient side are equally stark. Fewer than 5% of adult cancer patients in the U.S. participate in clinical trials, despite surveys showing that over 70% of patients would be willing to enroll if given the opportunity. The gap isn't reluctance — it's awareness and access. Studies have found that nearly half of patients never learn about a trial they'd be eligible for, and physicians themselves are often unaware of relevant open trials for their patients.

## Why Recruitment Is So Hard

The difficulty is multifaceted. Trial eligibility criteria can be extraordinarily complex — a single oncology trial may have 30–50 inclusion/exclusion criteria spanning biomarkers, prior treatments, organ function thresholds, and comorbidities. Matching a patient's full medical history against these criteria is a labor-intensive process that typically falls on already-overburdened clinical staff.

Geography compounds the problem. Roughly 70% of potential participants live more than two hours from the nearest trial site, creating a systemic bias toward patients in urban academic medical centers and away from rural, minority, and underserved populations. This directly undermines the diversity and generalizability of trial results — a growing concern for regulators and the research community alike.

## The Cost of Delay

Recruitment delays are the single largest driver of clinical trial cost overruns. Each day a trial runs behind schedule costs sponsors an estimated $600,000 to $8 million in lost revenue for late-to-market drugs. The average Phase III trial takes 1–2 years just to recruit, and the full drug development cycle averages 10–15 years and $2.6 billion from lab to approval. Recruitment inefficiency accounts for a meaningful share of both the time and money.

## Why It Matters for Patients

For patients — especially those with serious, rare, or treatment-resistant conditions — a clinical trial may represent the only path to a potentially life-saving therapy. Late-stage cancer patients, people with rare diseases (of which there are over 7,000, collectively affecting ~400 million people worldwide), and those who have exhausted standard-of-care options depend on access to experimental treatments. Every month a trial is delayed in recruiting is a month those patients go without access.

Moreover, clinical trial participation is itself associated with better outcomes. Research has shown that patients enrolled in trials — even those receiving placebos — often experience better care due to the rigorous monitoring, structured protocols, and specialist attention inherent to the trial process.

## The Diversity Imperative

Historically, clinical trials have enrolled disproportionately white, male, and affluent participants. Only about 5% of oncology trial participants in the U.S. are Black, despite Black Americans bearing a disproportionate cancer burden. Latino and Indigenous populations are similarly underrepresented. This undermines the science — drugs may behave differently across genetic backgrounds, metabolic profiles, and social determinants of health — and it perpetuates health inequities. The FDA has increasingly pushed for diversity action plans, but the matching infrastructure to reach underserved populations remains inadequate.

## The Opportunity

The convergence of electronic health records, natural language processing, and AI-driven matching creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity to close this gap — automatically screening patients against trial criteria, surfacing relevant opportunities to both patients and physicians, and dramatically compressing the recruitment timeline. Getting this right doesn't just accelerate drug development. It democratizes access to cutting-edge care and ensures that the therapies we develop actually work for the full diversity of people who will use them.

**The bridge between clinical trials and the patients who need them is broken. Rebuilding it is one of the highest-impact problems in healthcare today.**
