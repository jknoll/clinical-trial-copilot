# TODO
The briefing report link is 404 when I click on it. I would like a clean and well designed PDF clinical trial report that can load in the browser and be printed or saved.
We should expose the phases and subagents in the UI. Add a row at the bottom which shows each subagent/phases and outputs the agent's activity alongside the agent.
Include a label next to every item shown in the data pane. Make the labels title case, e.g. not RECRUITING but Recruiting.O
If the user's disease isn't in the top n list, add it and highlight it at the bottom of the list.
As constraints are added via the chat, they should be added to the data panel query in realtime and update it incrementally.
